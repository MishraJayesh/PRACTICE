        <h1>Tribute To My Hero</h1>
        <p>My hero, my father actually not only mine but if we think a while then we can conclude that our dad's are actually a real life hero.
            The reason for this is that he always fulfills our demands family's needs and seeks for our safety and securrity.
            And the best part is that he never show this that he do all this and that's the reason why many of us just don't know that under what kind of tremendous stress he is facing that too for well being of his family.
            And fairly speaking he doesn't like this and even don't deserve this but he didn't complain and if even he want to do then who is there to listen to his situation who is there to say him that don't worry i am there as he use to say to us,
            actually no one, like us he use to be stress free when his father is with him but now he even doesn't have him. He scold us sometimes even slapps us
            but that too for our well being. he doesn't want us to be wrong to be incorrect to be unsuccessful. His actual happiness lies in our success.
            he is the real hero of us he make sure that we have all what we need what we demand and what ever is best for us and he always work for making that to us.
            he travel daily in the tremendous rush in trains he don't eat outside for saving money so that those money can buy something for us and by that we will be happy and by seeing us happy he will be happy.
